## Features

### Tasks
The tasks page provides a checklist for you to keep track of daily tasks. Tasks can be marked as
completed by pressing the checkbox on the left-hand side, or you can choose from a variety of
different auto-completion conditions that will automatically track your progress.

At the end of each day, all completed tasks are removed unless they are given a *renew period*.
Tasks can be given a renew period (daily, weekly, monthly, anually) to automatically reactivate
themselves after completion.

Task Types:
- **Basic**: Requires manual completion.
- **Collect**: Collect an item, with an optional count. e.g. "Collect 100 wood"; "Find a diamond"
- **Craft**: Craft an item, with an optional count. e.g. "Craft a solar panel"; "Make 5 wood lamp-post"
- **Build**: Construct a farm building (provides cost tracking). e.g. "Build a barn"; "Build a deluxe coop"
- **Upgrade Tool**: Upgrade a tool (provides cost tracking). e.g. "Upgrade my axe"
- **Gift**: Give someone a gift, with an optional item specification. e.g. "Give robin a red plate"; "Give a poppy to Penny"
- **Buy**: Buy an item, with an optional count (provides cost tracking). e.g. "Buy potato seeds"; "Buy 100 coal"
- **Sell**: Sell an item, with an optional count (provides cost tracking). e.g. "Sell 10 tea sapling"; "Sell my lava katana"

When adding a task, the above task types can be applied automatically or manually by opening the *options menu*.

### Notes
The notes page provides a section for writing down anything that's beyond the scope of a task.
Fill it with anything you want!

## Mod Integration
There is some rudimentary support for adding custom pages and there's groundwork done for custom tasks.
If there's interest, I can add some more information on this and implement support for it.
